# Testflight Distribution

If you are a BC Diabetes client, you will be provided the application through Testflight. By default, we will disable FreeAPS X automatic updates as major updates can reset your preferences.

To ensure updates are disabled:

1. Open TestFlight on your iPhone
2. Tap on the FreeAPS X app
3. TURN Off Automatic Updates under App Information
4. Repeat this process on any other devices that have FreeAPS X listed in TestFlight.

!!! warning
    Please be proactive in updating your application at least every 90 days, else you may experience the error message "Beta App has Expired." Additionally, new updates have additional features and fixes for bugs that could be impacting your control.

To update, first write down or screenshot your current preferences and settings. Then navigate to TestFlight and hit the "Update" button besides the app.
