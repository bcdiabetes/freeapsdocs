# Testflight Distribution

If you are a BC Diabetes client, you will be provided the application through Testflight. By default, we will disable iAPS automatic updates as major updates can reset your preferences.

To ensure updates are disabled:

1. Open TestFlight on your iPhone
2. Tap on the iAPS app
3. TURN Off Automatic Updates under App Information
4. Repeat this process on any other devices that have iAPS listed in TestFlight.

!!! warning
    Please be proactive in updating at minimum every 90 days, else you may experience the error message "Beta App has Expired." Updates have fixes for bugs and new features.

To update, first write down or screenshot your current preferences and settings. Then navigate to TestFlight and hit the "Update" button besides the app.
