# Target Ranges
!!! abstract "Highlights"
    - Set your lower target between 5-6 mmol/L

This allows you to set your target blood sugar range. Note that by default, FreeAPS X (and OpenAPS) ignore your higher value unless "Wide BG Target Range" is enabled in preferences. In other words, if your range is set at 5-5.5 mmol/L, FreeAPS X treats it as 5-5 mmol/L.

Generally, a low target between 5-6 mmol/L is set by most users, or 1.5 mmol/L points above where they start feeling a low.
