!!! abstract "Highlights"
    - Max Basal = 4x max daily basal
    - Max Bolus = Max bolus you give for a meal
    - DIA = 7 hours

## Delivery Limits
These are safety limiters for iAPS. For Max Basal, 4 times your highested scheduled basal rate is generally adequate. For Max Bolus, choose the maximum amount of insulin you generally bolus for meals. 

## Duration of Insulin Action
Duration of insulin action (DIA) affects iAPS calculations through its impact on insulin on board (IOB). The default DIA of 5 hours is likely too low and can cause insulin stacking. Increasing to 7 hours should suit most users.
