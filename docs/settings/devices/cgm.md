# CGM
This section allows you to choose your glucose data source. Most options are self explanatory. If you are using a Dexcom G5 or G6 sensor, it is important you change your transmitter ID in the iAPS app for it to continue receiving glucose information. For more information on compatible CGMs, please see the following: [link](../../intro/)

xDrip is not recommended with newer versions of the iAPS app.
