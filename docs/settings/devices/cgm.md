# CGM
This section allows you to choose your glucose data source. Most options are self explanatory. If you are using a Dexcom G5 or G6 sensor, it is important you change your transmitter ID in the FreeAPS X app for it to continue receiving glucose information.

xDrip is not recommended with newer versions of the FreeAPS X app.
